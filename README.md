# ComputerHardMode
Have you ever felt that your computer was too easy to use? Do you want a challenge when you try to click things? Do you want windows to randomly close? If so, turn on hard mode with "Computer Hard Mode: Hard Mode For Your Computer".

This code is made with python 3.6, and it has a MIT licence.

There are a few different "tools" to make it hard to use the computer, and I will try to add more all the time.
Here is a list:
1. Random Mouse Movements:
  
  These are fun. It will move your mouse <= +/- 35 pixels in a random direction ever ten iterations of the while loop (just the right amount of movement and time to be the most horrible).
  
  
2. Random arrow key presses:
  
  These just press the arrow keys (not fun to type w/).


3. Random alt+tab presses:
  
  Every so often your computer preses alt+tab.


4. Random alt+f4 presses:
  
  Every so oftener, your computer presses alt+f4. Wanna know what it does? Press it right now!


5. Random Win+E presses:
  
  Want some file explorer?


6. Random Win presses:
  
  Want some start menu?


7. Volume? Up.
 
  It WILL turn your volume up. IDK when, IDK how.


8. Random right/left clicks on a random piont:
 
  This is gonna be fun.


9. Random drags across the screen:
 
  D = CPA


10. Hehe
